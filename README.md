# Genetic Algorithm for Maklink Graph Path Optimization

## Overview

This is a university project that implements an evolutionary algorithm to optimize path planning using Maklink graphs. The project combines classical computational geometry (Maklink graphs) with modern optimization techniques (genetic algorithms) to find optimal paths in 2D environments with triangular obstacles.

## Project Description

### Problem Statement
Path planning in environments with obstacles is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer science. This project addresses the challenge of finding not just feasible paths, but optimal paths through complex 2D environments containing triangular obstacles.

### Solution Approach
The project implements a two-stage approach:
1. **Maklink Graph Construction**: Creates a visibility graph connecting obstacle vertices and environment boundaries
2. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Optimizes waypoint positions along the Maklink lines to minimize total path length

## Algorithms Implemented

### Maklink Graph Algorithm
- Constructs visibility lines between obstacle vertices
- Adds perpendicular lines from vertices to environment boundaries
- Removes intersecting lines to ensure valid connections
- Creates adjacency matrix for graph representation
- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path through the graph

### Genetic Algorithm
- **Population**: Each individual represents waypoint positions (0.0-1.0) along Maklink lines
- **Selection**: Roulette wheel selection based on fitness scores
- **Crossover**: Single-point crossover with configurable rate (default: 80%)
- **Mutation**: Adaptive mutation with individual gene-specific rates based on path influence
- **Fitness**: Inverse of path length with elitism preservation

## Features

- **Multiple Environment Support**: Load environments from YAML configuration files
- **Visualization**: Real-time plotting of environments, obstacles, Maklink graphs, and optimized paths
- **Adaptive Mutation**: Individual mutation rates based on local path optimization potential
- **Comparative Analysis**: Support for comparing different mutation strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Run algorithms on multiple environments for statistical analysis

### Custom Environment Creation

```python
from environment import Environment, Point
from genetic_algorithm import create_environment, run_genetic_algorithm

# Create custom environment
obstacles = [
    [Point(1.0, 1.0), Point(2.0, 1.0), Point(1.5, 2.0)],
    [Point(8.0, 8.0), Point(9.0, 8.0), Point(8.5, 9.0)]
]
start_point = Point(0.5, 0.5)
end_point = Point(9.5, 9.5)

env = create_environment(10.0, 10.0, obstacles, start_point, end_point)
optimized_length = run_genetic_algorithm(env, population_size=200, max_generations=100)
```

### Environment Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
- environment:
    x: 10.0                    # Environment width
    y: 10.0                    # Environment height
    start_point:
      x: 0.5
      y: 0.5
    end_point:
      x: 9.5
      y: 9.5
    obstacles:                # List of triangular obstacles
      - - x: 1.0              # Triangle vertex 1
          y: 1.0
        - x: 2.0              # Triangle vertex 2
          y: 1.0
        - x: 1.5              # Triangle vertex 3
          y: 2.0
